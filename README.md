## About The Project

Speak Genie is a demonstration of a modern, voice-controlled digital assistant. In a world increasingly focused on hands-free interaction, this project showcases how to build an intuitive "genie" that listens to user queries, processes them, and provides intelligent, spoken responses.

The primary goal of Speak Genie is to create a seamless conversational user experience. It leverages modern web technologies to capture microphone input, communicate with natural language processing (NLP) services, and deliver real-time, audible feedback. This demo serves as a powerful foundation for building more complex voice-activated applications, from smart home controls to accessibility tools.



## Features

* **Voice Command Recognition:** Utilizes the browser's built-in Web Speech API to listen for and transcribe spoken commands in real-time.
* **Conversational AI:** Processes natural language to understand user intent and formulate relevant answers.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Communicates back to the user with a clear, computer-generated voice, making the interaction feel like a real conversation.
* **Interactive UI:** A clean and simple interface that provides visual feedback, showing when the genie is listening, processing, or speaking.

## Getting Started

This section will guide a new user on how to get your project up and running.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your machine.

* npm
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/dinosauronthemoon/speak-genie-final-demo.git](https://github.com/dinosauronthemoon/speak-genie-final-demo.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory and install NPM packages
    ```sh
    cd speak-genie-final-demo
    npm install
    ```
3.  Enter your API Key in the relevant configuration file (e.g., `config.js` or `.env`)
    ```js
    const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API KEY HERE';
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, simply click the "Activate Genie" button and speak your command or question clearly into your microphone. For example, you could try:

* *"What's the weather like in Kothri Kalan?"*
* *"Tell me a fun fact."*
* *"Set a timer for 5 minutes."*

The genie will indicate that it's listening and will respond verbally once it has processed your request.
